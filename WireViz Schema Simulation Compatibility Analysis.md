# WireViz Schema Simulation Compatibility Analysis

WireViz schemas, while excellent for wiring harness documentation, have significant limitations when it comes to direct simulation use. This analysis examines the compatibility pathways between WireViz outputs and electrical simulation tools, providing practical guidance for leveraging your wire harness documentation in simulation environments.

## WireViz Design Purpose and Simulation Limitations

WireViz is fundamentally designed as a **documentation tool** for cables, wiring harnesses, and connector pinouts rather than an electrical simulation platform[^12]. The tool takes YAML-formatted input files and produces beautiful graphical output (SVG, PNG) thanks to GraphViz, along with automatic Bill of Materials (BOM) creation[^12]. However, this documentation-focused design creates inherent limitations for simulation use.

The tool excels at representing physical wiring construction but lacks the electrical modeling capabilities required for circuit simulation[^6]. As noted in community discussions, "WireViz is not designed to represent the complete wiring of a system. Its main aim is to document the construction of individual wires and harnesses"[^12]. This fundamental design philosophy means that while WireViz can show you what connects to what, it cannot directly provide the electrical characteristics needed for simulation.

WireViz to Simulation Tool Workflow and Compatibility Paths

## Format Compatibility Analysis

The compatibility between WireViz outputs and simulation requirements reveals significant gaps that must be addressed through conversion workflows. WireViz produces several output formats including GraphViz (.gv) files, visual diagrams (SVG/PNG), BOMs in TSV format, and HTML reports[^4][^12]. However, electrical simulators typically require SPICE netlists (.cir, .net, .sp files), component electrical models, and analysis commands - none of which WireViz directly provides[^17][^19].

The comparison reveals that while WireViz provides valuable documentation and component lists, electrical simulators need fundamentally different data structures. SPICE simulators require textual representations of circuits with electrical parameters, component models defining electrical behavior, and specific analysis commands for simulation setup[^17][^18]. This mismatch necessitates either manual conversion or the use of specialized conversion tools.

WireViz Capabilities vs Electrical Simulation Requirements Gap Analysis

## Conversion Pathways and Workflows

### Manual SPICE Conversion Approach

The most common pathway involves manually extracting data from WireViz outputs to create SPICE netlists. This process begins with exporting the WireViz BOM in TSV format, which provides component lists and wire specifications[^4]. Wire resistances can then be calculated using the formula R = ρ × (L/A), where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area[^37]. The calculated resistances are manually entered into a SPICE netlist format for simulation in tools like LTSpice or other circuit simulators[^19][^21].

### Professional Wire Harness Analysis Tools

For complex automotive and aerospace applications, professional wire harness analysis tools offer more sophisticated capabilities. Siemens Capital Harness Analyzer enables visualization and analysis of technical vehicle data based on established industry formats including KBL (Kabelbaum Language)[^36]. Vector PREEvision provides comprehensive wire harness design workflows enabling streamlined electrical design from concept to production[^33]. Zuken E3.WiringSystemLab enables optimization of wiring harnesses with unprecedented speed and accuracy, including weight and cost analysis[^31].

These professional tools typically require conversion from WireViz YAML format to industry-standard formats like KBL or VEC (Vehicle Electric Container)[^33][^36]. While this conversion is not direct, the structured nature of WireViz data makes it feasible to develop conversion scripts or use intermediate formats.

### Hybrid Documentation-Simulation Approach

A practical workflow combines WireViz's documentation strengths with dedicated simulation tools. This approach uses WireViz for manufacturing documentation and visual representation while recreating the circuit in simulation tools using the WireViz output as reference[^5]. The workflow maintains both representations: WireViz for physical implementation guidance and simulation tools for electrical analysis.

## Community Efforts and Feature Requests

The WireViz community has actively discussed simulation integration possibilities. GitHub issue \#124 specifically addresses netlist input/output capabilities, with community members noting that "netlist import would allow wireviz to be able to import and export from schematics from eda tools"[^9]. The PySpice netlist parser has been suggested as a potential integration point for experimental work[^9].

Feature requests for include files (GitHub issue \#274) demonstrate community interest in more modular, simulation-friendly approaches[^2]. Users working with automotive wiring harnesses have requested the ability to define connectors in separate files for better integration with existing EDA workflows[^2]. However, as noted in community feedback, "Being completely outside my existing EDA workflow is not a feature"[^3].

## Integration with Existing EDA Tools

Several pathways exist for integrating WireViz data with established EDA tools. KiCad users can leverage netlist generation capabilities, though this requires manual recreation of the WireViz circuit in KiCad's schematic editor[^28][^30]. The kicad-netlist-reader Python module provides programmatic access to KiCad netlists, potentially enabling conversion scripts[^43][^40].

Altium Designer offers LTSpice import capabilities through the LTSpice Import Wizard, but this requires the circuit to first exist in LTSpice format[^21][^24]. For users working with multiple design tools, this suggests a workflow where WireViz documentation guides manual circuit recreation in intermediate tools before final simulation.

## Practical Implementation Strategies

For immediate simulation needs, the most practical approach involves manual extraction of critical parameters from your WireViz schema. Wire gauge information (AWG/mm²) and length data can be used to calculate wire resistances for inclusion in SPICE netlists. Component lists from the BOM can guide the selection of appropriate electrical models in simulation tools.

Python-based conversion scripts offer automation possibilities for repetitive workflows. The Python Framework for Modular and Parametric SPICE Netlists Generation demonstrates approaches for programmatic netlist creation. While not directly compatible with WireViz, these frameworks provide templates for developing custom conversion tools.

For organizations with complex harness requirements, investment in professional tools like Siemens Capital or Vector PREEvision may be justified. These tools provide comprehensive electrical analysis capabilities while supporting industry-standard exchange formats that could potentially interface with WireViz data through custom conversion processes.

## Conclusion

Your WireViz schema cannot be directly used with electrical simulators without significant conversion effort. The tool's strength lies in physical wiring documentation rather than electrical simulation. However, several viable pathways exist for leveraging your WireViz work in simulation environments, ranging from manual parameter extraction to sophisticated professional tool workflows.

The most practical immediate approach involves using your WireViz output as documentation to guide manual circuit recreation in dedicated simulation tools. For long-term solutions, consider developing conversion scripts or investing in professional wire harness analysis tools that can provide both documentation and simulation capabilities. The WireViz community continues to explore simulation integration possibilities, suggesting that future versions may offer enhanced compatibility with electrical analysis workflows.
